Abstract
--------

Inspired by symplectic geometry and a microlocal characterizations of perverse (constructible) sheaves we consider an alternative definition of perverse coherent sheaves.
We show that a coherent sheaf is perverse if and only if Î“_Z(F) is concentrated in degree 0 for special subvarieties Z of X.
These subvarieties Z are analogs of Lagrangians in the symplectic case.
