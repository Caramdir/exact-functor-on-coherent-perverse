\begin{abstract}
    Inspired by symplectic geometry and a microlocal characterizations of constructible perverse sheaves we consider an alternative definition of perverse coherent sheaves:
    we show that a coherent sheaf is perverse if and only if $R\lc Z\sheaf F$ is concentrated in degree $0$ for special subvarieties $Z$ of $X$.
    These subvarieties $Z$ are analogs of Lagrangians in the symplectic case.

\section{introduction}

A general way to obtain insights about the heart of a t-structure is to study exact functors on the t-structure.
For example, for the category of constructible perverse sheaves on a complex manifold, one can obtain a large amount of exact functors by taking vanishing cycles \cite[Corollary~10.3.13]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds}.

Let $\sheaf F$ be a constructible (middle) perverse sheaf on an affine Kähler manifold $X$.
Let $x ∈ X$ be point and $f\colon X → ℂ$ a suitably chosen holomorphic Morse function with $f(x) = 0$ and single critical point $x$.
Then the stalk $(ϕ_{\!f}\sheaf F)_x$ is concentrated in cohomological degree $0$.
A more \enquote{geometric} formulation of this statement can be obtained in the following way.
Let $L$ be the stable manifold for the gradient of the Morse function $\Re f$.
Write $ι_x \colon \{x\} \hookrightarrow L$ and $ι_L\colon L \hookrightarrow X$ for the inclusions.
Then $ι_x^*ι_L^! \sheaf F$ is also concentrated in cohomological degree $0$.
Note that $L$ is a Lagrangian with respect to the symplectic structure given by the Kähler form.

Now consider a symplectic variety $X$ (in the sense of \cite{Beauville:2000:SymplecticSingularities}) with an action by a group $G$ such that the $G$-orbits give a symplectic foliation of $X$.
In this situation there is a middle perversity t-structure on the derived category $D_c^b(X)^G$ of coherent $G$-equivariant sheaves (see Section~\ref{sec:Kashiwara} for a review of the theory of perverse coherent sheaves).
Let $L$ be a Lagrangian on $X$, i.e.\ a smooth subvariety that intersects every symplectic leaf in a Lagrangian.
Let $\sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G$ be a perverse coherent sheaf on $X$.
Following the intuition obtained in the constructible case, is natural to ask whether the\ !-restriction $ι_L^!\sheaf F$ of $\sheaf F$ to $L$ is concentrated in degree $0$.

For an arbitrary variety $X$ with a $G$-action that has finitely many orbits, we define the notion of a \emph{measuring subvariety} as an analog of a Lagrangian in the symplectic case (Definition~\ref{def:measuring}).
Our main theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm:main}) then states that a coherent sheaf $\sheaf F ∈ D^b_c(X)^G$ is perverse if and only if $ι_Z^!\sheaf F$ is concentrated in cohomological degree $0$ for all measuring subvarieties $Z$ of $X$.

\begin{Ex}
    Let $N$ be the nilpotent cone in the complex Lie algebra $\liesl n$ and let $G = \SL n$ act on $N$ adjointly.
    Then the dimensions of the $G$-orbits in $N$ are known to be even dimensional.
    Thus there exists a middle perversity $p$ with $p(O) = \frac12 \dim O$ for each $G$-orbit $O$.
    Let $X$ be the flag variety for $\liesl n$ and $μ\colon T^*X → N$ the Springer resolution.
    Choose a point $x ∈ X$.
    Then $T_x^*X$ is a Lagrangian in $T^*X$ and one can show explicitly that $μ(T_x^*X)$ is a measuring subvariety of $N$.
    Thus a sheaf $\sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(N)^G$ is perverse if and only if $R\lc{μ(T_x^*X)}\sheaf F$ is concentrated in degree $0$ for all $x ∈ X$.
\end{Ex}

Since the motivating observation about constructible perverse sheaves does not seem to be in the literature (though \cite[Theorem~3.5]{MirkovicVilonen:2007:GLdualityRepresentations} is is the same spirit), we give a direct proof of the statement in the appendix.

\subsection{setup and notation}

Let $X$ be a Noetherian separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field $k$.
Let $G$ be an algebraic group over $k$ acting on $X$.
Until Section~\ref{sec:measuring} we include the possibility of $G$ being trivial.
We write $X^{\mathrm{top}}$ for the subset of the Zariski space of $X$ consisting of generic points of $G$-invariant subschemes and equip $X^{\mathrm{top}}$ with the induced topology.
To simplify notation, if $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ is any point, we write $\overline x$ for the closure $\overline{\{x\}}$ and $\dim x = \dim \overline x$.

We write $D(X)$, $D_{qc}(X)$ and $D_c(X)$ for the derived category of $\O_X$-modules and its full subcategories consisting of complexes with quasi-coherent and coherent cohomology sheaves respectively.
The corresponding categories of $G$-equivariant sheaves (i.e.\ the categories for the quotient stack $[X/G]$) are denoted $D(X)^G$, $D_{qc}(X)^G$ and $D_c(X)^G$.
As usual, $D^b(X)$ (etc.) is the full subcategory of $D(X)$ consisting of complexes with cohomology in only finitely many degrees.
All functors are derived, though we usually do not explicitly mention it in the notation.

\begin{cgs}
    Any basic introduction to derived categories will be sufficient in order to understand this article.
    The correct construction of the derived category of equivariant sheaves is somewhat involved, but not really necessary here, since all constructions will factor through the forgetful functor to non-equivariant category.
    The $G$-action is only used as a way to introduce something akin to a stratification on $X$.
    The equivariance condition forces the coherent sheaves to be vector bundles on each orbit and reduces the possible maps between sheaves so that the cone of a map is of that form (cf.~the introduction of~\cite{ArinkinBezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}).
\end{cgs}

For a subset $Y$ of a topological space $X$ we write $ι_Y$ for the inclusion of $Y$ into $X$. 
If $x ∈ X$ is a point, then we simply write $ι_x$ for $ι_{\{x\}}$.
Let $Z$ be a closed subset of $X$.
For an $\O_X$-module $\sheaf F$ let $\lc Z\sheaf F$ be the subsheaf of $\sheaf F$ of sections with support in $Z$ \cite[Variation~3 in \textsc{iv}.1]{Hartshorne:1966:ResiduesAndDuality}.
By abuse of notation, we simply write $\lc Z$ for the right-derived functor $R\lc Z\colon D_{qc}(X) → D_{qc}(X)$.
Recall that $\lc Z$ only depends on the closed subset $Z$, and not on the structure of $Z$ as a subscheme.

Let $x$ be a (not necessarily closed) point of $X$ and $\sheaf F ∈ D^b(X)$.
Then $\mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F = \sheaf F_x ∈ D^b(\catModules{\O_x})$ denotes the (derived) functor of talking stalks.
We further set $\mathbf ι_x^!\sheaf F = \mathbf ι_x^*\lc {\overline x}$, cf.~\cite[Variation~8 in \textsc{iv}.1]{Hartshorne:1966:ResiduesAndDuality}.

\begin{cgs}
    The original reference on local cohomology is~\cite{SGA2}.
    A good English book about it is~\cite{BrodmannSharp:1998:LocalCohomology}.
    Unfortunately, both texts don't use the formalism of derived categories and I don't know any comprehensive reference that develops local cohomology in that setting.
    However it should be pretty straightforward to translate the relevant results.
\end{cgs}

We assume that $X$ has a $G$-equivariant dualizing complex $\sheaf R$ (see~\cite[Definition~1]{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}) which we assume to be normalized, i.e.\ $\mathbf ι_x^! \sheaf R$ is concentrated in degree $-\dim x$ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$.
For $\sheaf F ∈ D(X)$ (or $D(X)^G$) we write $\dualize \sheaf F = \sheafHom_{\O_X}(\sheaf F,\sheaf R)$ for its dual.

\begin{cgs}
    Recall that the essential properties of the duality functor are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the functor $\dualize$ takes $D^b_{c}(X)$ to $D^b_c(X)$ (resp.~$D_c^b(X)^G$ to $D_c^b(X)^G$);
        \item for $\sheaf F ∈ D^b_c(X)$ (or $D^b_c(X)^G$), the natural morphism $\sheaf F → \dualize\dualize F$ is an isomorphism;
        \item for $x ∈ X$, $\mathbf ι_x^!(\sheaf R)$ is concentrated in degree $-\dim x$ (where $\dim x \coloneq \dim\overline x$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{cgs}

\section{perverse coherent sheaves}
\label{sec:Kashiwara}%

By \emph{perversity} we mean a function $p\colon \{0,\dotsc,\dim X\} → ℤ$.
For $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ we abuse notation and set $p(x) = p(\dim x)$.
Then $p\colon X^{\mathrm{top}} → ℤ$ is a perversity function in the sense of~\cite{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}.
Note that we insist that $p(x)$ only depends on the dimension of $\overline x$.
A perversity is called \emph{monotone} if it is decreasing and \emph{comonotone} if the \emph{dual perversity} $\overline p(n) \coloneq -n - p(n)$ is decreasing.
It is \emph{strictly monotone} (resp.~\emph{strictly comonotone}) if for all $x,y ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ with $\dim x < \dim y$ one has $p(x) > p(y)$ (resp.~$\overline p(x) > \overline p(y)$).
Note that a strictly monotone perversity is not necessarily strictly decreasing (e.g.~if $X$ only has even-dimensional $G$-orbits).

Recall that if $p$ is a monotone and comonotone perversity then Bezrukavnikov (following Deligne) defines a t-structure on $D_c^b(X)^G$ by taking the following full subcategories \cite{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves,ArinkinBezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}:
\begin{align*}
    \perv[p] D^{≤0}(X) & = 
    \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G : \mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F ∈ D^{≤p(x)}(\catModules{\O_x}) \text{ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$}\bigr\}, \\
    \perv[p] D^{≥0}(X) & = 
    \bigl\{ \sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G : \mathbf ι_x^!\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥p(x)}(\catModules{\O_x}) \text{ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$}\bigr\}.
\end{align*}
The heart of this t-structure is called the category of perverse sheaves with respect to the perversity $p$.

\begin{cgs}
    The original paper~\cite{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves} is easier to understand (as it doesn't use stacks). 
    However~\cite{ArinkinBezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves} uses better notation (in particular the $ℂ$-module and $\O$-module restriction functors are notationally differentiated).
    So I'd recommend reading the two papers in parallel.
\end{cgs}

In~\cite{Kashiwara:2004:tStructureOnHolonomicDModuleCoherentOModules}, Kashiwara also gives a definition of a perverse t-structure on $D^b_{c}(X)$.
While we work in Bezrukavnikov's setting (i.e.\ in the equivariant derived category on a potentially singular scheme), we need a description of the perverse t-structure that is closer to the one Kashiwara uses.
This is accomplished in the following proposition.

\begin{Prop}\label{prop:equivDeligneKashiwara}%
    Let $\sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G$ and let $p$ be a monotone and comonotone perversity function.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item
            The following are equivalent:
            \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
                \item $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$, i.e.\ $\mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F ∈ D^{≤p(x)}(\catModules{\O_x})$ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$;
                \item $p(\dim \supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)) ≥ k$ for all $k$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item
            If $p$ is strictly monotone, then the following are equivalent
            \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
                \item $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{\ge 0}(X)$, i.e.\ $\mathbf ι_x^!\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥p(x)}(\catModules{\O_x})$ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$;
                \item $\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥p(x)}(X)$ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$;
                \item $\lc {Y}\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥p(\dim Y)}(X)$ for all $G$-invariant closed subvarieties $Y$ of $X$;
                \item $\dim\left( \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) ≤ -p(x) - k$ for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ and all $k$.
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Prop}

A crucial fact that we will implicitly use quite often in the following arguments is that the support of a coherent sheaf is always closed\textcgs{\ (e.g.~\cite[Exercise~II.5.6c]{Hartshorne:AG})}.
In particular, this means that if $x$ is a generic point and $\sheaf F$ a coherent sheaf, then $\mathbf ι_x^* \sheaf F = 0$ if and only if $\res{\sheaf F}U = 0$ for some open set $U$ intersecting $\overline x$.

\pagebreak
\begin{proof}\leavevmode
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item
            First let $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$ and assume for contradiction that there exists an integer $k$ such that $p(\dim \supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)) < k$.
            Let $x$ be the generic point of an irreducible component of maximal dimension of $\supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)$.
            Then $H^k(\mathbf ι_x^* \sheaf F) \ne 0$. 
            But on the other hand, $\mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F ∈ D^{≤p(x)}(\catModules{\O_x})$ and $p(x) = p(\dim \supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)) < k$, yielding a contradiction.

            Conversely assume that $p(\dim \supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)) ≥ k$ for all $k$ and let $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$.
            If $H^k(\mathbf ι_x^*\sheaf F) \ne 0$, then $\dim x ≤ \dim \supp H^{k}(\sheaf F)$.
            Thus monotonicity of the perversity implies that $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$.
        \item
            The implications from (iii) to (ii) and (ii) to (i) are trivial and the equivalence of (ii) and (iv) follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:supportAndLocalCohomology+} below.
            Thus we only need to show that (i) implies (iii).
            So assume that $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}(X)$.
            We induct on the dimension of $Y$.
            
            If $\dim Y = 0$, then $Γ(X,\lc Y \sheaf F) = \bigoplus_{y ∈ Y^{\mathrm{top}}} \mathbf ι_y^!\sheaf F$ and thus $\lc Y\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥p(0)}(X)$ by assumption.

            Now let $\dim Y > 0$.
            We first assume that $Y$ is irreducible with generic point $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$.
            Let $k$ be the smallest integer such that $H^k(\lc {\overline x} \sheaf F) \ne 0$ and assume that $k < p(x)$.
            We will show that this implies that $H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F) = 0$, giving a contradiction.

            We first show that $H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)$ is coherent.
            Let $j\colon X \setminus {\overline x} \hookrightarrow X$ and consider the distinguished triangle
            \[
                \lc {\overline x} \sheaf F → \sheaf F → j_*j^* \sheaf F \xrightarrow{+1}.
            \]
            Applying cohomology to it we get an exact sequence
            \[
                H^{k-1}(j_*j^*\sheaf F) → H^k(\lc{\overline x} \sheaf F) → H^k(\sheaf F).
            \]
            By assumption, $k-1 \le p(x) - 2$, so that $H^{k-1}(j_*j^*\sheaf F)$ is coherent by the Grothendieck Finiteness Theorem in the form of \cite[Corollary~3]{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}.
            As $H^k(\sheaf F)$ is coherent by definition, this implies that $H^k(\lc{\overline x} \sheaf F)$ also has to be coherent.

            Set $Z = \supp H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)$.
            Then, since $ι_x^* H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F) = H^k(\mathbf ι_x^! \sheaf F)$ vanishes, $Z$ is a proper closed subset of $\overline x$.
            We consider the distinguished triangle
            \[
                H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)[-k] →
                \lc {\overline x}\sheaf F →
                τ_{>k}\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F \xrightarrow{+1},
            \]
            and apply $\lc Z$ to it:
            \[
                \lc Z H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)[-k] =
                H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)[-k] →
                \lc Z \sheaf F →
                \lc Z τ_{>k}\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F \xrightarrow{+1}.
            \]
            Since $\dim Z < \dim x$, we can use the induction hypothesis and monotonicity of $p$ to deduce that $\lc Z \sheaf F$ is in degrees at least $p(\dim Z) \ge p(x) > k$.
            Clearly $\lc Z τ_{>k}\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F$ is also in degrees larger than $k$.
            Hence $H^k(\lc {\overline x}\sheaf F)$ has to vanish.

            If $Y$ is not irreducible, let $Y₁$ be an irreducible component of $Y$ and $Y₂$ be the union of the other components.
            Then there is a Mayer-Vietoris distinguished triangle
            \[
                \lc {Y₁\cap Y₂} \sheaf F → \lc {Y₁} \sheaf F \oplus \lc{Y₂}\sheaf F → \lc{Y} \sheaf F \xrightarrow{+1},
            \]
            where $\lc {Y₁\cap Y₂} \sheaf F ∈ D^{\ge p(\dim Y₁\cap Y₂)}(X) \subseteq D^{\ge p(\dim Y)+1}$ (by the induction hypothesis and strict monotonicity of $p$) and $\lc{Y₁} \sheaf F$ and $\lc{Y₂} \sheaf F$ are in $D^{\ge p(\dim Y)}(X)$ by induction on the number of components of $Y$.
            Thus $\lc Y \sheaf F ∈ D^{\ge p(\dim Y)}$ as required.
            \qedhere
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{Lem}[{\cite[Proposition~5.2]{Kashiwara:2004:tStructureOnHolonomicDModuleCoherentOModules}}]%
    \label{lem:supportAndLocalCohomology+}%
    Let $\sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)$, $Z$ a closed subset of $X$, and $n$ an integer.
    Then $\lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D_{qc}^{≥n}(X)$ if and only if $\dim(Z∩\supp(H^k(\dualize \sheaf F))) \le - k - n$ for all $k$.
\end{Lem}

\textcgs{An analogous lemma holds in the topological situations, see~\cite[Exercise~X.10]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds}.}

This lemma extends \cite[Proposition~5.2]{Kashiwara:2004:tStructureOnHolonomicDModuleCoherentOModules} to singular varieties.
The proof is same as for the smooth case, but we will include it here for completeness.

\begin{proof}
    By~\cite[Proposition~\textsc{vii}.1.2]{SGA2}, $\lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D_{qc}^{\ge n}(X)$ if and only if 
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:supportAndCohomology+}%
        \sheafHom(\sheaf G,\sheaf F) ∈ D_c^{\ge n}(X)
    \end{equation}
    for all $\sheaf G ∈ \catCoh{X}$ with $\supp \sheaf G \subseteq Z$.
    Let $d(n) = -n$ be the dual standard perversity.
    Then by~\cite[Lemma~5a]{Bezrukavnikov:arXiv:PerverseCoherentSheaves}, \eqref{eq:supportAndCohomology+} holds if and only if $\dualize \sheafHom(\sheaf G,\sheaf F) ∈ \perv[d] D^{\le -n}(X)$.
    By~\cite[Proposition~\textsc{v}.2.6]{Hartshorne:1966:ResiduesAndDuality}, $\dualize \sheafHom(\sheaf G,\sheaf F) = \sheaf G \otimes_{\O_X} \dualize \sheaf F$, so that by Proposition~\ref{prop:equivDeligneKashiwara}(a) we need to show that
    \[
        \dim \supp H^{k}\left(\sheaf G \otimes_{\O_X} \dualize \sheaf F\right) \le - k - n 
    \]
    for all $k$.
    By~\cite[Lemma~5.3]{Kashiwara:2004:tStructureOnHolonomicDModuleCoherentOModules} this is equivalent to
    \[
        \dim \left(Z∩\supp H^{k}(\dualize \sheaf F)\right) \le - k - n
    \]
    for all $k$, completing the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{measuring subvarieties}
\label{sec:measuring}%

From now on we assume that the $G$-action has finitely many orbits.

\begin{Def}\label{def:measuring}%
    Let $p$ be a perversity.
    A \emph{$p$-measuring subvariety} of $X$ is a closed subvariety $Z$ of $X$ such that the following conditions hold for each $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ with $\overline x ∩ Z \ne \emptyset$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\dim(\overline x ∩ Z) = p(x) + \dim x$;
        \item $\overline x ∩ Z$ is the underlying variety of a regularly embedded subscheme in $\overline x$, i.e., up to radical $\overline x ∩ Z$ it is locally defined in $\overline x$ by exactly $-p(x)$ functions.
    \end{itemize}

    We say that $X$ has \emph{enough $p$-measuring subvarieties} if for each $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ there exists a $p$-measuring subvariety $Z$ with $Z ∩ \overline x \ne \emptyset$.
\end{Def}

\begin{Rem}\label{rem:existence}%
    Let $Z$ be a $p$-measuring subvariety.
    Then $\dim(\overline x ∩ Z) = -\overline p(x)$.
    Thus comonotonicity of $p$ ensures that if $\dim y ≤ \dim x$ then $\dim (\overline y ∩ Z) ≤ \dim (\overline x ∩ Z)$ for each $p$-measuring $Z$.
    Monotonicity of $p$ then further says that $\dim (\overline x ∩ Z) - \dim (\overline y ∩ Z) ≤ \dim x - \dim y$.
    We clearly have $0 \le \dim(\overline x ∩ Z) \le \dim x$ and hence $-\dim x \le p(x) \le 0$.
    We will show in Theorem~\ref{thm:existance} that these condition are actually sufficient for the existence of enough $p$-measuring subvarieties, at least when $X$ is affine.
\end{Rem}

\begin{Thm}\label{thm:main}%
    Let $p$ be a strictly monotone and (not necessarily strictly) comonotone perversity and assume that $X$ has enough $p$-measuring subvarieties.
    Then,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\perv[p] D^{≤0}(X) = \left\{ \sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G : \lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D^{≤0}(X) \text{ for all $p$-measuring subvarieties $Z$}\right\}$;
        \item $\perv[p] D^{≥0}(X) = \left\{ \sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G : \lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥0}(X) \text{ for all $p$-measuring subvarieties $Z$}\right\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore the sheaf $\sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G$ is perverse with respect to $p$ if and only if $\lc Z\sheaf F$ is cohomologically concentrated in degree $0$ for each $p$-measuring subvariety $Z$.
\end{Thm}

The following lemma encapsulates the central argument of the proof of the first part of the theorem.

\begin{Lem}\label{lem:supportAndLocalCohomology-}%
    Let $\sheaf F ∈ \catCoh{X}^G$ be a $G$-equivariant coherent sheaf on $X$, let $p$ be a monotone perversity and let $n$ be an integer.
    Assume that $X$ has enough $p$-measuring subvarieties.
    Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $p(\dim \supp \sheaf F) ≥ n$;
        \item \label{li:lem:supportAndLocalCohomology-:2}%
            $H^i(\lc Z\sheaf F) = 0$ for all $i ≥ -n+1$ and all measuring subvarieties $Z$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
    Since $\supp \sheaf F$ is always a union of the closure of orbits, we can restrict to the support and assume that $\supp \sheaf F = X$.

    First assume that $p(\dim X) = p(\dim \supp \sheaf F) ≥ n$.
    Using a Mayer-Vietoris argument it suffices to check condition (\ref{li:lem:supportAndLocalCohomology-:2}) in the case that $X$ is irreducible.
    By the definition of a $p$-measuring subvariety and monotonicity of $p$, this implies that, up to radical, $Z$ can be locally defined by at most $-n$ equations.
    Thus $H^i(\lc Z\sheaf F) = 0$ for $i > -n$ \cite[Theorem~3.3.1]{BrodmannSharp:1998:LocalCohomology}. 

    Now assume conversely that $H^i(\lc Z\sheaf F) = 0$ for all $i ≥ -n+1$ and all measuring subvarieties $Z$.
    We have to show that $p(\dim X) ≥ n$.
    Set $d = \dim X$.
    Choose any $p$-measuring subvariety $Z$.
    Then $\codim_X Z = -p(d)$.
    We will show that $H^{-p(d)}(\lc Z \sheaf F) \ne 0$ and hence $p(d) \ge n$ by assumption.
    Take some affine open subset $U$ of $X$ such that $U \cap Z$ is non-empty and irreducible in $U$.
    It suffices to show that the cohomology is non-zero in $U$.
    Thus we can assume without loss of generality that $X$ is affine, say $X = \Spec A$, and $Z$ is irreducible.
    Write $Z = V(\ideal p)$ for some prime ideal $\ideal p$ of $A$.
    By flat base change~\cite[Theorem~4.3.2]{BrodmannSharp:1998:LocalCohomology},
    \[
    Γ(X,H^{-p(d)}(\lc Z \sheaf F))_{\ideal p} = 
    \left(H_{\ideal p}^{-p(d)}(Γ(X,\sheaf F))\right)_{\ideal p} =
    H_{\ideal p_{\ideal p}}^{-p(d)}(Γ(X,\sheaf F)_{\ideal p})
    \]
    Since $\dim \supp \sheaf F = \dim X = d$, the dimension of the $A_{\ideal p}$-module $Γ(X,\sheaf F)_{\ideal p}$ is $-p(d)$.
    Thus by the Grothendieck non-vanishing theorem~\cite[Theorem~6.1.4]{BrodmannSharp:1998:LocalCohomology}
    %\cite[Théorème~V.3.1]{SGA2}
    $H_{\ideal p_{\ideal p}}^{-p(d)}(Γ(X,\sheaf F)_{\ideal p}) \ne 0$ and hence $Γ(X,H^{-p(d)}(\lc Z \sheaf F)) \ne 0$ as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:main}]\leavevmode
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
    We use the description of $\perv[p] D^{≤0}(X)$ given by Proposition~\ref{prop:equivDeligneKashiwara}, i.e.
    \[
    \perv D^{≤0}(X) = \left\{ \sheaf F ∈ D_c^b(X)^G : p\left(\dim\left( \supp H^{n}(\sheaf F) \right)\right) ≥ n \text{ for all $n$}\right\}.
    \]
    We induct on the largest $k$ such that $H^k(\sheaf F) \ne 0$ to show that $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$ if and only if $\lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D^{≤0}(X)$ for all $p$-measuring subvarieties $Z$.

    The equivalence is trivial for $k \ll 0$.
    For the induction step note that there is a distinguished triangle
    \[
    τ_{<k} \sheaf F → \sheaf F → H^k(\sheaf F)[-k] \xrightarrow{+1}.
    \]
    Applying the functor $\lc Z$ and taking cohomology we obtain an exact sequence
    \begin{multline*}
        \cdots →
        H¹(\lc Z(τ_{<k} \sheaf F)) →
        H¹(\lc Z\sheaf F) →
        H^{k+1}(\lc Z(H^k(\sheaf F))) → \\
        H²(\lc Z(τ_{<k} \sheaf F)) →
        H²(\lc Z\sheaf F) →
        H^{k+2}(\lc Z(H^k(\sheaf F))) →
        \cdots.
    \end{multline*}
    By induction, $H^j(\lc Z(τ_{<k} \sheaf F))$ vanishes for $j ≥ 1$ so that $H^j(\lc Z\sheaf F) \cong H^{k+j}(\lc Z(H^k(\sheaf F)))$ for $j ≥ 1$.
    Thus the statement follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:supportAndLocalCohomology-}.
\item 
    By Proposition~\ref{prop:equivDeligneKashiwara}(b), $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}$ if and only if
    \begin{align}
        \label{eq:main:+supp1}%
        & \dim\left( \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) ≤ -p(x) - k &  \text{for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ and all $k$}. \\
        %
        \intertext{Using Lemma~\ref{lem:supportAndLocalCohomology+} for $\lc Z\sheaf F ∈ D^{≥0}(X)$, we see that we have to show the equivalence of \eqref{eq:main:+supp1} with}
        %
        \notag
        & \dim\left( Z ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) ≤ - k & \quad \text{ for all $k$ and $p$-measuring $Z$}. \\
        %
        \intertext{Since there are only finitely many orbits, this is in turn equivalent to}
        %
        \label{eq:main:+supp2}%
        & \dim\left( Z ∩ \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) ≤ - k & \text{ $\forall\, x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$, $k$ and $p$-measuring $Z$}.
    \end{align}
    We will show the equivalence for each fixed $k$ separately.
    Let us first show the implication from \eqref{eq:main:+supp1} to \eqref{eq:main:+supp2}.
    Since $H^k(\dualize \sheaf F)$ is $G$-equivariant and there are only finitely many $G$-orbits, it suffices to show \eqref{eq:main:+supp2} assuming that $\dim x \le \dim \supp H^k(\dualize F)$ and $\overline x \cap \supp H^k(\dualize F) \ne \emptyset$.
    Then $\dim\left(\overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right)\right) = \dim \overline x$.
    Thus,
    \begin{multline*}
        \dim\left(Z ∩ \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) \le
        \dim(Z ∩ \overline x) =
        p(x) + \dim x = \\
        p(x) + \dim\left(\overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right)\right) \le
        p(x) - p(x) - k
        = -k.
    \end{multline*}
    
    Conversely, assume that \eqref{eq:main:+supp2} holds for $k$.
    If $\overline x \cap \supp H^k(\dualize F) = \emptyset$, then \eqref{eq:main:+supp1} is trivially true.
    Otherwise choose a $p$-measuring $Z$ that intersects $\supp H^k(\dualize F)$.
    First assume that $\overline x$ is contained in $\supp H^k(\dualize F)$.
    Then
    \begin{multline*}
        \dim\left(\overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right)\right) =
        \dim x =
        -p(x) + \dim(Z ∩ \overline x) = \\
        -p(x) + \dim\left(Z ∩ \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) \le
        -p(x) - k.
    \end{multline*}
    Otherwise $\overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) = \overline y$ for some $y ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ with $\dim y < \dim x$.
    Then \eqref{eq:main:+supp1} holds for $y$ in place of $x$ and hence
    \[
    \dim\left( \overline x ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) =
    \dim\left( \overline y ∩ \supp\left( H^k(\dualize F) \right) \right) ≤
    -p(y) - k ≤
    -p(x) - k
    \]
    by monotonicity of $p$.
    \qedhere
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{Ex}
    For the dual standard perversity $p(n) = -n$ (i.e.\ $p(x) = -\dim x$), we recover the definition of Cohen-Macaulay sheaves~\cite[Section~\textsc{iv}.3]{Hartshorne:1966:ResiduesAndDuality}.
\end{Ex}

Of course, for the theorem to have any content, one needs to show that $X$ has enough $p$-measuring subvarieties.
The next theorem shows that at least for affine varieties there are always enough measuring subvarieties whenever $p$ satisfies the obvious conditions (see Remark~\ref{rem:existence}).

\begin{Thm}\label{thm:existance}%
    Assume that $X$ is affine and the perversity $p$ satisfies $-n \le p(n) \le 0$ and is monotone and comonotone.
    Then $X$ has enough $p$-measuring subvarieties.
\end{Thm}

\begin{proof}
    Let $X = \Spec A$.
    We induct on the dimension $d$.
    More precisely, we induct on the following statement:
    \begin{quote}
        There exists a closed subvariety $Z_d$ of $X$ such that for all $x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}}$ the following holds:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $Z_d \cap \overline x \ne \emptyset$ and $Z_d \cap \overline x$ is regularly embedded in $\overline x$;
            \item if $\dim x \le d$, then $\dim(\overline x ∩ Z_d) = p(x) + \dim x$;
            \item if $\dim x > d$, then $\dim(\overline x ∩ Z_d) = p(d) + \dim x$.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{quote}
    We set $p(-1) = 0$.
    The statement is trivially true for $d = -1$, e.g.~take $Z = X$.
    Assume that the statement is true for some $d \ge -1$.
    We want to show it for $d+1 \le \dim X$.

    If $p(d) = p(d+1)$, then $Z_{d+1} = Z_{d}$ works.
    Otherwise, by (co)monotonicity, $p(d+1) = p(d) - 1$.
    Set $S = \bigcup \{ \overline x ∈ X^{\mathrm{top}} : \dim x \le d\}$.
    Since there are only finitely many orbits, we can choose a function $f$ \textcgs{(by choosing individual $f_i$ and multiplying them)}such that $f$ vanishes identically on $S$, $V(f)$ does not share a component with $Z_d$ and $V(f)$ intersects every $\overline x$ with $\dim x > d$.
    Then $Z_{d+1} = Z_d \cap V(f)$ satisfies the conditions.
\end{proof}

\appendix

\section*{appendix. constructible sheaves}

We return now to the claim about exact functors on the t-structure of constructible perverse sheaves made in the introduction.
Let $X$ be a complex manifold and $\setset S$ a finite stratification of $X$ by complex submanifolds.
We write $D^b_{\setset S}(X)$ for the bounded derived category of $\setset S$-constructible sheaves on $X$.
We call a sheaf $\sheaf F ∈ \smash[t]{D^b_{\setset S}(X)}$ perverse if it is perverse with respect to the middle perversity function on $\setset S$.
We are going to formulate and prove an analog of Theorem~\ref{thm:main} in this situation.

A closed real submanifold $Z$ of $X$ is called a \emph{measuring submanifold} if for each stratum $S$ of $X$ either $Z ∩ \overline S = \emptyset$ or $\dim_ℝ Z ∩ S = \dim_ℂ S$.

\begin{Thm}
    A sheaf $\sheaf F ∈ D^b_{\setset S}(X)$ is perverse if and only if $ι_Z^! \sheaf F$ is concentrated in cohomological degree $0$ for each measuring submanifold $Z$ of $X$.
\end{Thm}

The proof of the following lemma is based on a MathOverflow post by Geordie Williamson \cite{MO:VanishingShriekRestrictionConstructible}.
The author takes responsibility for possible mistakes.

\begin{Lem}\label{lem:constructible_local_vanishing}%
    Let $X$ be a real manifold, $\sheaf F$ be a constructible sheaf (concentrated in degree $0$) on $X$ and let $i\colon Z \hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusion of a closed submanifold.
    Then $H^j(i^!\sheaf F) = 0$ for $j>\codim_XZ$.
\end{Lem}

\begin{proof}
    By taking normal slices we can reduce to the case that $Z = \{z\}$ is a point.
    Let $j$ be the inclusion of $X \setminus \{z\}$ into $X$ and consider the distinguished triangle
    \[
        i_!i^! \sheaf F → \sheaf F → j_*j^*\sheaf F \xrightarrow{+1}.
    \]
    By~\cite[Lemma~8.4.7]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds} we have
    \[
        H^j(j_*j^*\sheaf F)_z = H^j(S^{\dim X - 1}_ε, \sheaf F)
    \]
    for a sphere $S^{\dim X - 1}_ε$ around $x$ of sufficiently small radius.
    The latter cohomology vanishes for $j \ge \dim X$ and hence $H^j(i^! \sheaf F) = 0$ for $j>\dim X$ as required.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem]
    Clearly it is enough to check the condition on a collection of measuring submanifolds $\{ Y_i \}$ such that each connected component of each stratum has non-empty intersection with at least one $Y_i$.
    Similarly to Theorem~\ref{thm:existance}, one shows inductively that such a collection of submanifolds exists.
    
    Define two full subcategories $\perv[L] D^{\le 0}(X)$ and $\perv[L] D^{\ge 0}(X)$ of $D^b_{\setset S}(X)$ by
    \begin{align*}
        \perv[L] D^{≤0}(X) & = \left\{ \sheaf F ∈ D^b_{\setset S}(X) : ι_Z^! \sheaf F ∈ D^{≤0}(Z) \text{ for all measuring submanifolds $Z$} \right\}, \\
        \perv[L] D^{≥0}(X) & = \left\{ \sheaf F ∈ D^b_{\setset S}(X) : ι_Z^! \sheaf F ∈ D^{≥0}(Z) \text{ for all measuring submanifolds $Z$} \right\}.
    \end{align*}
    We will show that these categories are the same as the categories $\perv D^{≤0}(X)$ and $\perv D^{≥0}(X)$ defining the perverse t-structure on $D^b_{\setset S}(X)$.

    We induct on the number of strata.
    If $X$ consists of only one stratum and $Z$ is a measuring submanifold, then $ι_Z^! \sheaf F \cong ω_{Z/X} \otimes ι_Z^* \sheaf F$ and hence $ι_Z^! \sheaf F$ is in degree $0$ if and only if $\sheaf F$ is in degree $-\frac 12 \dim_ℝ X$.
    So assume that $X$ has more then one stratum.
    Without loss of generality we can assume that $X$ is connected.
    Let $U$ be the union of all open strata and $F$ its complement.
    Both $U$ and $F$ are unions of strata of $X$.
    Let $j$ be the inclusion of $U$ and $i$ the inclusion of $X$. 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 
            If $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$, then $\sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≤0}$ follows in exactly the same way as in the coherent case, using Lemma~\ref{lem:constructible_local_vanishing}.
        \item 
            Let $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}(X)$.
            Then $i^! \sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}(F)$ and $j^*\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}(U)$.
            Let $Z$ be a measuring subvariety.
            Consider the distinguished triangle 
            \[ 
                i_*i^! \sheaf F → \sheaf F → j_*j^*\sheaf F.
            \]
            Using base change, induction and the (left)-exactness of the push-forward functors one sees that $ι_Z^!$ of the outer sheaves in the triangle are concentrated in non-negative degrees.
            Thus so is $ι_Z^! \sheaf F$.
        \item 
            Let $\sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≥0}(X)$.
            Since all measurements are local this implies that $j^* \sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≥0}(U) = \perv D^{≥0}(U)$.
            Using the same triangle and argument as in the last point, this implies that also $i^! \sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≥0}(F) = \perv D^{≥0}(F)$.
            Hence, by recollement, $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≥0}(X)$.
        \item 
            Finally, let $\sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≤0}(X)$.
            Again this immediately implies that $j^* \sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≤0}(U) = \perv D^{≤0}(U)$.
            Thus $j_!j^*\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$.
            Let $Z$ be a measuring submanifold and consider the distinguished triangle
            \[
                ι_Z^! j_!j^*\sheaf F → ι_Z^! \sheaf F → ι_Z^! i_*i^* \sheaf F.
            \]
            By what we already know, the first sheaf is concentrated in non-positive degrees and hence so is $ι_Z^! i_*i^* \sheaf F$.
            By base change and the exactness of $i_*$ this implies that $i^* \sheaf F ∈ \perv[L] D^{≤0}(F) = \perv D^{≤0}(F)$.
            Hence, by recollement, $\sheaf F ∈ \perv D^{≤0}(X)$.
            \qedhere
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{Rem}
    The equality $\perv D^{≥0}(X) = \perv[L]D^{≥0}(X)$ could also be proved in exactly the same way as in the coherent case, using~\cite[Exercise~\textsc{x}.10]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds}.
