\section{Traditional setting}

Let $X$ be an $n$-dimensional complex smooth Kähler manifold.
Let $p$ be a point in $X$.
Let $f\colon X → ℂ$ be a \emph{generic} \emph{holomorphic} Morse function (note that everything is local, so that we can assume that non-constant holomorphic functions exist), such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f(p) = 0$;
    \item $\res{df}p = 0$;
    \item $\res{Hf}p $ is non-degenerate \me($Hf$ is the Hessian of $f$)\david.
\end{itemize}
Then there exist local coordinates such that $f \sim z₁² + z₂² + \dotsb + z_n² + (\text{h.o.\ terms})$.

Consider $\Re f\colon X → ℝ$,
\[
\Re f \sim x₁² + \dotsb + x_n² - y₁² - \dotsb -y_n² + (\text{h.o.\ terms}).
\]
Let $C_{f,p}^-$, $C_{f,p}^+$ be cells of flow lines for the gradient of $\Re f$ with respect to the Kähler metric.
\me(I assume that these are the same as the stable and unstable manifolds for the gradient of $\Re f$.)
\David
Note that $C_{f,p}^-$, $C_{f,p}^+$ are $n$-dimensional real manifolds, transversely intersecting at $p$.

\begin{Prop}
    $C_{f,p}^-$, $C_{f,p}^+$ are Lagrangian with respect to the Kähler form.
\end{Prop}

Let $i_p$ denote the inclusion of $p$ into $C_{f,p}^-$ and $C_{f,p}^+$.
Let $j_{p,f}^\pm\colon C_{f,p}^\pm \hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusions.

\begin{Thm}
    Let $\sheaf F$ be a bounded complex of sheaves with constructible cohomology.
    Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\sheaf F$ is perverse;
        \item For all $p ∈ X$ and $f$ as above, $i_p^* {j_{p,f}^+}^! \sheaf F$ and $i_p^!{j_{p,f}^-}^* \sheaf F$ are in degree $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Thm}

Note that the roles of $+$ and $-$ can be reversed by multiplying $f$ by $\i$.

\begin{Q}
    Does a similar statement hold for any smooth Lagrangian?
\end{Q}

\section{Coherent setting}

Let $X$ be a complex variety and $G$ a group acting on $X$ so that all orbits are even-dimensional. 

\begin{Conjecture}
    A $G$-equivariant sheaf $\sheaf F$ on $X$ is perverse if and only if for all Lagrangian subvarieties $L$ of $X$ and all $p ∈ L$ the complexes $i_p^*i_L^! \sheaf F$ and $i_p^!i_L^* \sheaf F$ are (cohomologically) concentrated in degree $0$.
\end{Conjecture}

\subsection{The two-dimensional case}

We want to show that if $\sheaf F$ satisfies the Lagrangian condition, then it is perverse.

Let $U$ be the open orbit.
If $p ∈ U$ and $L$ be a Lagrangian through $p$.
Then $p$ is non-characteristic \cite[Def.~5.4.12]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds}\footnote{The remark after this definition appears to be incorrect. The word \enquote{smooth} should be replaced by \enquote{a submersion}} for $\sheaf F$ and hence by \cite[Proposition~5.4.13]{KashiwaraSchapira:1994:SheavesOnManifolds} we have an isomorphism $i_p^{!}i_L^*\sheaf F \cong i_p^*i_L^*\sheaf F \otimes ω_{p/L}$.
Since $ω_{p/L}$ is concentrated in degree $1$, it follows that $\sheaf F_p$ is in degree $-1$ for all $p ∈ U$ and hence $\res{\sheaf F}U$ is in degree $-1$ as required.

Now let $0$ be a fixed point of the action and let $L$ be a Lagrangian through $0$.
Then for all $p ∈ L$ the complex $i_p^* i_L^!\sheaf F$ is in degree $0$.
Hence $i_L^! \sheaf F$ is also in degree $0$ and thus $i_0^! \sheaf F = i_0^!i_L^! \sheaf F$ is in degrees $\ge 0$.

Finally we have to show that $i_0^* \sheaf F$ is in degrees $\le 0$.
By the preceding arguments, we know that $i_p^*i_L^*\sheaf F$ is concentrated in degree $-1$.
So we need to show the following lemma.

\begin{Lem}
    Let $L$ be a curve, $0 ∈ L$ and $\sheaf F ∈ D^{\le 1}(L)$ so that the following conditions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\sheaf F_p$ is (cohomologically) in degree $-1$ for all $p \ne 0$.
        \item $i_0^! \sheaf F$ is (cohomologically) in degree $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Then $\sheaf F ∈ D^{\le 0}(L)$.
\end{Lem}

Essentially, we know that $H^i(\sheaf F)$ is a skyscraper at $0$ for $i \ne -1$. 
If $H^1(L) \ne 0$, then this implies that $i_0^!H¹(\sheaf F) = i_0^*H¹(\sheaf F) \ne 0$.
We have to show that this contradicts that $H¹(i_0^!\sheaf F) = 0$.
